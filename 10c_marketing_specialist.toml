# 10Clouds AI & R&D process description

## AI from hourly consultation to Nasdaq development process
Main USPs of a project:
- From on hour consultation to Nasdaq
- Start very small and agile as if you would with a freelancer and get to big full scale production.
- Best experts at integrating AI Solutions into products, on technical, bussines and user interface /experience levels.
- End to end solutions
- Variety of services provided - one stop shop.

Timeline of an AI project:
1. Initial strategy consultation (~1 hour)
2. Small consulting project resulting with a PoC (~10 hours)
3. Full scale consulting project around advanced AI topics, adressing any uncertainties (maybe there is more in the XIO offer, should consult Jan/ Hossein). Testing open source models? (Also include offering that I prepared for XIO
4. Full scale MVP development that includes non AI product development, integrations, and testing framework and repeatable results from AI.
5. Production development into full public release, post MVP, mantanance and scaling.
6. Establishing a dedicated polish department of your startup, selling part of the team as part of Series A or Stock Exchange entry.

We have went through this kind of path with Trustamp which is currently traded on Nasdaq (and started from nothing).

Those materials should also show that we can not only consult but can do full end to end development, the detail of our service offering you can find in the OFFERING section.

You can find an example consulting offer description in  CONSULTING R&D OFFER section.

## CONSULTING R&D OFFER
R&D Process for AI Development Based on OpenAI and Open source models

1. The R&D Process:
Our proposed research and development (R&D) process emphasizes iterative experimentation through small research milestones. This structure is defined by:
Iterative Milestones: Each research milestone is allocated dedicated hours (e.g., 15 or 30), depending on problem complexity. The primary objective is to construct a proof of concept (PoC) for specific problems.
Addressing Uncertainties: We prioritize problems with the most uncertainties for verification. This ensures a smoother transition to standard development, as most challenges are already comprehended and tackled.

2. Benefits of the Proposed Process:
Short-term Tangible Outcomes: This approach consistently yields tangible short-term prototypes, even though long-term deliverables aren’t guaranteed. Clients can assess these prototypes and decide on the trajectory and scale of subsequent endeavors.
Client Involvement and Oversight: The transparent nature of our process allows clients to remain closely involved. In the rare instance where satisfaction isn’t met, the process is structured to accommodate additional oversight or collaboration.
Visible Outcomes with GPT: Working with models like GPT provides results that are immediately observable, facilitating rapid insights and iterative adjustments.

3. Deliverables:
Proof of Concept Prototypes: At the conclusion of each milestone, a PoC prototype is developed, showcasing the feasibility and efficacy of the research.
Chatbots and Response Systems: These are designed to render outputs based on specific inputs, making their quality easily assessable.
Model Exploration and Refinement: This deliverable encompasses:
Testing Various Architectures: Exploring different model architectures to determine the best fit.
Prompt Engineering: Crafting and refining prompts to guide the AI models effectively.
Model Selection and Fine-Tuning: Identifying, choosing, and fine-tuning the most suitable models for the project’s specific needs.

4. MVP vs. Our R&D Process:
While the conventional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach centers on result predictability and long-term foresight, our R&D process embraces the unpredictable facets of AI research. We value experimentation and adjustments rooted in real-time findings, rather than solely relying on established technologies.

Additional Note on Quality Assurance:
As we transition into standard development following the R&D phase, the integration of a Language Model Monitoring (LLM) testing framework is recommended. This will ensure continuous monitoring of the models’ performance and maintain the quality of responses.
In summation, our tailored R&D process for AI development seeks to address the unique challenges and opportunities in the AI domain. Through methodical milestones, collaborative engagement with clients, and a focus on navigating uncertainties, we aim to equip XIO with a cutting-edge natural language interface for their trading platform.

Using the dimensions mentioned, let's dive into a comparative analysis of Flutter, React Native, and Native development (taking Swift for iOS and Kotlin/Java for Android as representatives for native development):

1. Platform Support:
  * Flutter: Cross-platform (iOS, Android), with ambitions for web and desktop.
  * React Native: Primarily iOS and Android. There are community-driven projects for extending to other platforms.
  * Native: Platform-specific. Swift for iOS, Kotlin/Java for Android.
2. Performance:
  * Flutter: Uses the Skia graphics engine and can achieve near-native performance. Widgets are drawn directly on the screen.
  * React Native: Offers near-native performance. For computationally heavy operations, it might require native modules.
  * Native: Offers peak performance, direct access to platform APIs, and full hardware capabilities.
3. Development Speed:
  * Flutter: Hot reload, significant code reusability.
  * React Native: Hot reload, high code reusability.
  * Native: No hot reload (Swift offers some live previews), no code reusability between platforms.
4. Language:
  * Flutter: Dart
  * React Native: JavaScript (can also use TypeScript)
  * Native: Swift (iOS), Kotlin/Java (Android)
5. Ecosystem & Libraries:
  * Flutter: Growing ecosystem with pub.dev for packages. Younger than React Native.
  * React Native: Mature ecosystem, plenty of libraries and community contributions.
  * Native: Vast, mature ecosystems with first-party support and countless third-party libraries.
6. UI Components:
  * Flutter: Offers a rich set of highly customizable widgets.
  * React Native: Uses native components. Additional components can be used from the community or third parties.
  * Native: Direct access to all native UI components and animations.
7. Integration with Native Features:
  * Flutter: Requires platform channels to integrate with native features.
  * React Native: Uses native modules to integrate with platform-specific features.
  * Native: Direct integration without any bridges or channels.
8. Community & Support:
  * Flutter: Rapidly growing community backed by Google.
  * React Native: Strong, mature community supported by Facebook.
  * Native: Massive community, with support from platform creators (Apple for Swift, Google for Kotlin).
9. Maintenance & Updates:
  * Flutter: Regular updates, with clear migration paths.
  * React Native: Regular updates, sometimes breaking changes can occur.
  * Native: Stable updates, often with backward compatibility.
10. Learning Curve:
* Flutter: Moderate, especially for those new to Dart.
* React Native: Relatively low, especially for JavaScript developers.
* Native: Steeper, with platform-specific paradigms and languages.
1. Cost:
* Flutter & React Native: Potentially lower development costs due to code reusability, but potential increased costs for troubleshooting platform-specific issues.
* Native: Potentially higher initial development costs for multiple platforms but fewer cross-platform issues.
1. Tooling:
* Flutter: Excellent tooling with Dart DevTools for debugging and profiling.
* React Native: Good tooling, especially when combined with developer tools from the JavaScript ecosystem.
* Native: Mature and feature-rich tooling with Android Studio and Xcode.
1. Longevity & Backing:
* Flutter: Backed by Google.
* React Native: Backed by Facebook.
* Native: Directly supported by platform creators (Apple for iOS, Google for Android).
1. Security:
* Flutter: Offers some built-in security features and relies on native layers for others.
* React Native: Relies heavily on the native side for security features.
* Native: Full access to platform-specific security features and best practices.

In conclusion, the decision among Flutter, React Native, or Native depends on various project-specific factors such as the team's proficiency with the languages, performance requirements, project duration, and maintenance considerations.
